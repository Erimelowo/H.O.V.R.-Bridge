# H.O.V.R. Bridge
A bridge application to enable [H.O.V.R.](https://payhip.com/b/nDEYw) to work in VRChat using OSC or Resonite using a WebSocket.
This was forked from [VRC-Haptic-Pancake](https://github.com/Z4urce/VRC-Haptic-Pancake) and rebranded using H.O.V.R.'s branding but is still compatible with it.

# Hardware
You can buy H.O.V.R. [here](https://payhip.com/b/nDEYw) or you can [make it yourself](https://github.com/Z4urce/VRC-Haptic-Pancake/wiki/Make-the-Pancake).

# Avatar setup
Avatar setup is a drag and drop using [VRCFury](https://vrcfury.com/download) and a prefab available [here](https://payhip.com/b/Ye28f).
