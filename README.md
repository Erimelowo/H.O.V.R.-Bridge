# Prerequisites

1. 3D printer (or access to a 3D printer service)
2. A vibration motor for each tracker. I recommend [this one.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004653448729.html "Link to Aliexpres")

# Guide
1. Let's 3D print the pancake! You can use any material, but using a TPU will grand an extra dampening effect what can improve your tracking.
2. Put the motor inside. If it feels lose, use a bit of duct tape on the side.
